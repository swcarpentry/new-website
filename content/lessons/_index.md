A Software Carpentry workshop is taught by at least one trained and badged Instructor. Over the course of the workshop, Instructors teach our three core topics: the Unix shell, version control with Git, and a programming language (Python or R). Curricula for these lessons in English and Spanish (select lessons only) are below.
